I have the latest image on the BeagleBone installed and working. I am using virtual box to run my virtual machine with a Linux OS for kernel development. Additionally, I have all the SD cards and parts
from the parts room kit. I have installed git on my host and also signed up for the two beagle Google groups. I have also created an etch-a-sketch program using python3. 

To call my etch-a-sketch program, use the command ./hw01.py --boxSize X 
from the directory in which the file is located where X indicates the height and width of the etch-a-sketch drawing area. For instance, putting in 20 for X will give you a 20x20 drawing area. 
If you leave this blank and just input ./hw01.py then the  size will default to a  10x10  drawing area. The program has built in instructions that guides you on what to do after the program is 
open and running. 


## Prof. Yoder's comments

Everything looks good.  Nice use of color in etch-a-sketch.
No write permission on repo.
