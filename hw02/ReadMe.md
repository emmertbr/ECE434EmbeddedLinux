To call my etch-a-sketch program, use the command ./hw02.py --boxSize X
from the directory in which the file is located where X indicates the height and width of the etch-a-sketch drawing area. For instance, putting in 20 for X will give you a 20x20 drawing area.
If you leave this blank and just input ./hw02.py then the  size will default to a  10x10  drawing area. The program has built in instructions that guides you on what to do after the program is
open and running. The LEDs on my breadboard light up in correlation with the button presses. When the reset button is pressed all four LEDs will light up. 

hw02Toggle.py is my program for toggling a GPIO pin in python.
hw02Toggle.c is my program for toggling a GPIO pin in C. 
hw02Toggle.txt is where I answered the questions relating the the toggling GPIO pins.
