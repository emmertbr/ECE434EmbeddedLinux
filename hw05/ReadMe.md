I have included the edited Makefile in my repository for the first section of the assignment.
I then installed the latest kernel on my bone. If you look at the screenclips in the 
helloworld bone compile and helloworld host compile files, you can see that I completed the 
cross compile. The screenclips in the Kernal Module Part 1 and Kernel Module Part 2 
files show that I completed the first two parts of the last part of the assignment. 
My code to turn the LED off/on on both the rising and falling edge is contained in the file
gpio_LED_Toggle.c


## Prof. Yoder's comments

Looks good. Nice screen clips
