Unfortunately, this homework caused me some problems. I was unable to get the mmap section figured out. If you look at the code in ReadSwitch.c you can see what I attempted to make work.

I was able to get the LCD screen working and properly rotated. The files BorisFlip and Name show the rotated Boris image and the screen with my name displayed on it to show that I was
able to get the LCD screen working properly.
