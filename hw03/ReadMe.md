The shell program that you can use to run my temperature sensors is in TMP101.sh
You will need to do a `config-pin P9_21 i2c` and `config-pin P9_22 i2c` prior to 
running it. 

EtchASketchhw03.py is the program that runs my EtchASketch program on the 8x8 LED Matrix. 
This one controls the LED matrix using buttons. The cursor always starts in the corner of
the screen and pressing the reset button will reset the screen of any lit LEDs. 

EncoderEtchASketchhw03.py is the program that runs my Etch A Sketch program using encoders. 
One encoder controls left and right movement and the other controls up and down movement. 
Pressing the reset button will reset the screen of any lit LEDs.
